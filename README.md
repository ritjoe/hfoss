This is a course content repository for the Humanitarian Free/Open Source
Software Development course (HFOSS) offered by the School of Interactive
Games and Media (IGM) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).

Everything in the ```ofcourse-content``` directory is meant to be served by [ofCourse](https://github.com/ryansb/ofcourse).
As of January 2018 that content was hosted at http://hfoss.rocfoss.org

It is complemented by student forks of this repository, by the [HFOSS library](https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss-library) and the associated [course wiki](https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss/wiki).
