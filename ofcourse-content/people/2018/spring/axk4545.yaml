bio: I am a student in the Networking and Systems Administration program at Rochester Institute of Technology. I have a very strong and passionate interest in Linux and the free and open source software community. I have been using varying distributions of Linux for roughly 7 years. I am currently using Red Hat based Fedora Linux as a primary OS.
